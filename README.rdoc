==Arbitrary number bases

So often, I need to create random number bases, with random digits, to satisfy some crazy requirement.

Here is an example of how you'd do hex in Anybase.

  base = Anybase.new('0123456789abcdef')
  base.to_i('f0a')
  => 3850
  base.to_native(123450)
  => "1e23a"

As well, you can tell Anybase to ignore case.

  base = Anybase.new('0123456789abcdef', :ignore_case => true)
  base.to_i('F0A')
  => 3850

Anybase can also have synonyms.

  base = Anybase.new('0123456789abcdef', :synonyms => {'0' => 'oO'})
  base.to_i('FoA')
  => 3850
  base.to_i('FOA')
  => 3850

Anybase can also zeropad your output with whatever your "zero" character is.

  Anybase.new("012345678").to_native(1234, :zero_pad => 8)
  => '00001621'

Anybase gives you a few built-in:
<tt>Anybase::Hex</tt>, <tt>Anybase::Base64</tt>, <tt>Anybase::Base64ForURL</tt> and <tt>Anybase::Base62</tt>
(should all be pretty self-explanatory)

As well, there is an <tt>AnyBase::Base73ForURL</tt>. This includes the characters:
<tt>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789$-_.+!*\'(),</tt>
